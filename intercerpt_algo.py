def intercept(roads, stations, start, friendStart):
    """
    Function description:
    Determines the optimal route to intercept a friend riding a train loop at the same time you arrive at a station.
    The goal is to minimise total cost. If multiple routes have the same cost, prefer the one with the least time.

    Approach:
    - Build the graph from the road network as an adjacency list.
    - Use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute minimum cost and time to all locations from the start.
    - Simulate the friend's movement on the train loop, tracking their station at each minute.
    - Identify if and when you can intercept your friend at the same location and time.
    - Return the route that minimises cost (and time if tied), or None if interception is impossible.

    :Input:
    roads: list of tuples (u, v, cost, time)
    stations: list of tuples (station_id, travel_time_to_next_station)
    start: starting location (integer)
    friendStart: starting train station of the friend (integer)

    (min_cost, min_time, route) or None
